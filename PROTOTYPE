Prototype Wiki

DESCRIPTION
We used the Trakt API for our project. With trakt, users are able to query a plethora
of data on tv shows and movies. This data includes, genres, recommendations, specific
episodes and what's currently trending. Thus far, we're only using Trakt to search for
movies and tv series by title and display said titles in a list below our search bar. When
users navigate to the detailed view of a result, they're presented again with the title
of the show, a poster, the year the show began was released and its score.
